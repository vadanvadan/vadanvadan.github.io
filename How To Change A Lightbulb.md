# How To Change A Light Bulb

Changing a light bulb is one of the easiest things you can do.
Changing a light bulb is one of the easiest home maintenance tasks. However, if you're unsure how to go about it, we’ve outlined this procedure below.


# What you need to do


 1. **Turn off the power**
First make sure the power is turned off. The safest way to do this is to switch the large red power button to **off** on the fuse box.

2. **Let it cool**
Allow the bulb to cool before touching it.

3. **Use a ladder**
Ensure you can safely reach the bulb by using a stepladder.

4. **Remove bulb**
Take the bulb out of the socket. The way you do this will depend on whether your bulb has a bayonet mount or a screw fitting:

**Bayonet Mount (two prongs, standard in the UK):**

Grasp the bulb lightly but firmly, push upwards gently and turn anticlockwise until it is released from the socket.

**Screw Fitting (most common in Europe):**

Keep gently twisting anticlockwise until the bulb comes loose from the socket.

5. **Replace the bulb**
Insert a replacement bulb lightly but firmly into the socket. Depending on the type, turn it clockwise until it locks into place or keep gently twisting clockwise until it won’t go any further.

6. **Restore power**
Once the bulb is in, turn the power back on again and switch on the light.

7. **Dispose of the old bulb**
The old bulb needs to be disposed of safely as the glass is fragile and very sharp. Use the packaging from the new bulb to wrap the old one for safe disposal.

As always, safety is crucial when working with electrical or wiring faults.

**Remember**

- Check the wattage on the used bulb and replace it with a bulb of the same wattage
-  Dispose of the bulb well out of the reach of children
-  Don’t put your fingers in the exposed light socket
